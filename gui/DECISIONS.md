# Decisions

Each entry is a choice made while building vio gui, and why. `PLAN.md` describes the design.

## G1. The library lives in the vio repository

It needs hooks in the loop core (G2) that change with it, and one CI run then checks both. It is
its own target, `vio_gui`, in its own directory, so it can move to its own repository once the
core hooks settle.

## G2. A host wait, not a host loop

The loop keeps control of the turn. On macOS and Windows a *host wait* replaces only the blocking
step. The other way round, where the window system's loop runs and calls vio, would make the turn
order depend on the platform, and every vio guarantee about it would need restating per platform.

## G3. Nested turns run inside modal loops

The open question in the core `DECISIONS.md` was whether coroutines should run while Win32 or Cocoa
holds the thread in a resize or move loop. They do. Without it, a window being resized shows
stale content, and I/O stalls for as long as the user holds the mouse button. `run_nested()` skips
each stage that is already running further up the stack, so no queue is walked twice at once.

## G4. Callbacks record, a hook resumes

Window-system callbacks only queue events. A before-block hook resumes the waiters. A coroutine
that closes its window then cannot free the window while Xlib, libwayland, AppKit or a window
procedure is still running on it.

## G5. Frames are requested, not pushed

Each await of `frame()` asks for one frame. A program that is idle draws nothing and the loop
sleeps. This matches `wl_surface.frame`, `requestAnimationFrame` and `CVDisplayLink`.

## G6. Graphics APIs are loaded at run time

EGL, GL, GLX and Vulkan are loaded with `dlopen` (or `LoadLibrary`) on first use. A program that
draws with Vulkan does not need libGL, and one that only opens windows needs neither.

## G7. Window systems are linked on Linux

libX11 and libwayland-client are linked. Both are present on any desktop that can show a window,
and loading them at run time would add a table of some two hundred function pointers for no
gain. The backend is chosen at run time: Wayland when `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` is set, X11 otherwise,
and `VIO_GUI_BACKEND=x11|wayland` overrides.

## G8. EGL for OpenGL on Linux

EGL works on X11 and Wayland alike, so one code path covers both. GLX would serve only X11.
